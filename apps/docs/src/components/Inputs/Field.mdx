# Field label

Help text provides either an informative description or an error message that gives more context about what a user needs to input. It’s commonly used in forms.

## Usage

<Unstyled>
  <MainView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={FieldStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

## Options

### Label

Inputs (text fields, checkboxes, sliders, etc.) should always have a
label. In rare cases where context is sufficient and an
accessibility expert has reviewed the design, the label could be
undefined. These inputs without a visible label should still include
an aria-label in HTML (depending on the context, “aria-label” or
“aria-labelledby”).

<Unstyled>
  <OptionsView />
</Unstyled>
<Canvas of={FieldStories.Label} sourceState="shown" />

### Label position

A label can be placed either on top or on the side of an input. This
option affects the bounding box of the component to ensure proper
alignment. Top labels are the default and are recommended because
they work better with long copy, localization, and responsive
layouts. Side labels are most useful when vertical space is limited.

<Canvas of={FieldStories.LabelPosition} sourceState="shown" />

### Size

Help text comes in four different sizes: small, medium, large, and
extra-large. The medium size is the default and most frequent
option. Use the other sizes sparingly and pair them with components
of the same size to respect the built-in hierarchy.

  <SizeView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={FieldStories.Size} sourceState="shown" />

### Disabled

A field label in a disabled state shows that an input field exists,
but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to
maintain layout continuity and communicate that an input field may
become available later.

<Unstyled>
  <DisabledView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={FieldStories.Disabled} sourceState="shown" />
