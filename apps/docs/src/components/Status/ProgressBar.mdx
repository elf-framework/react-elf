# Progress bar

Progress bars show the progression of a system operation: downloading, uploading, processing, etc., in a visual way. They can represent either determinate or indeterminate progress.

## Usage

<Unstyled>
  <MainView />
</Unstyled>

## Options

### Default variant

Progress bars are used to visually show the progression of a system
operation such as downloading, uploading, processing, etc. By
default, progress bars have a blue fill that shows the progress.

<Unstyled>
  <DefaultVariantView />
</Unstyled>

### Over background variant

When a progress bar needs to be placed on top of a colored
background, use the over background variant. This progress bar uses
a static white color regardless of the color theme. Make sure the
background offers enough contrast for the progress bar to be legible.

</Unstyled>

### Label

Progress bars should have a label that gives context about the
operation being performed. Use an ellipsis at the end of the label
text to communicate that the process is in progress. In rare cases
where context is sufficient and an accessibility expert has reviewed
the design, the label could be undefined. These progress bars should
still include an aria-label in HTML (depending on the context,
“aria-label” or “aria-labelledby”). The label is always placed above
the track.

  <LabelView />
</Unstyled>

### Value, min value, max value

The value is the progress of a system operation (e.g., downloading,
uploading, processing) within the progress bar’s range, from the min
value to max value.

The min and max values can also can be customized appropriately for
whatever the progress bar is showing. By default, the min value
starts at 0 and the max value is set to 100.

These values are not applicable when a progress bar is
indeterminate.

  <MinMaxValueView />
</Unstyled>

### Value label

Progress bars can have a value label that gives detailed information
about the progress (e.g. "60%" or "2 of 8"). This value label works
alongside the label and should not be displayed if the label itself
is not displayed. It should also not be displayed if the progress is
indeterminate. Similar to the label, the value label is always
placed above the track.

  <ValueView />
</Unstyled>

### width

The width of a progress bar can be customized appropriately for its context.
The default width is 192px on desktop and 240px on mobile.

<Unstyled>
  <WidthView />
</Unstyled>

### Size

Badges come in four different sizes: `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `extra-large`.
The small size is the default and most frequently used option.
Use the other sizes sparingly to create a hierarchy of importance on a page.

<Unstyled>
  <SizeView />
</Unstyled>

### Indeterminate

A progress bar can be either determinate or indeterminate. By
default, progress bars are determinate. Use a determinate progress
bar when progress can be calculated against a specific goal (e.g.,
downloading a file of a known size). Use an indeterminate progress
bar when progress is happening but the time or effort to completion
can’t be determined (e.g., attempting to reconnect to a server).
