# Toolbar

Toolbar is used for single and bulk selection patterns, when a user needs to perform actions on either a single or multiple items at the same time.

## Usage

<MainView />

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

<Controls />

## Options

### Emphasis

<OptionsView />

&nbsp;

An action bar is not emphasized by default. This is best used for when
it needs to blend in with the rest of the UI, directing a userâ€™s focus
to elsewhere in a view.

The emphasized action bar has a blue background that adds visual
emphasis on the actions and selection. Use this for when the bar
should call attention (e.g., floating in a table).

<Canvas of={ToolbarStories.Emphasis} sourceState="shown" />
