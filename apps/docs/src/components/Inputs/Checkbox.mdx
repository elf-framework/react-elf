# Checkbox

Checkboxes allow users to select multiple items from a list of individual items, or to mark one individual item as selected.

## Usage

<Unstyled>
  <MainView />
</Unstyled>

## Options

### Label

Checkboxes should always have a label. When the label is not defined, a checkbox becomes standalone. Standalone checkboxes are only used when their connection to other components is clear and they give sufficient context â€” for example, in application panels.

<Unstyled>
  <OptionsView />
</Unstyled>

### Selection

Checkboxes can be selected, not selected, or in an indeterminate state. They are in an indeterminate state when they represent both selected and not selected values.

<Unstyled>
  <SelectionView />
</Unstyled>

### Size

Checkboxes come in four different sizes: small, medium, large, and extra-large. The medium size is the default and most frequently used option. Use the other sizes sparingly; they should be used to create a hierarchy of importance within the page.

<Unstyled>
  <SizeView />
</Unstyled>

### Emphasis

By default, checkboxes are not emphasized (gray). This version is optimal for when the checkbox is not the core part of an interface,
such as in application panels, where all visual components are monochrome in order to direct focus to the content.

The emphasized (blue) version provides a visual prominence that is optimal for forms, settings, lists or grids of assets, and other situations where a checkbox need to be noticed.

<Unstyled>
  <EmphasisView />
</Unstyled>

### Disabled

A checkbox in a disabled state shows that a selection exists, but is not available in that circumstance.
This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that an action may become available later.

<Unstyled>
  <DisabledView />
</Unstyled>

### Error

Checkboxes can be marked as having an error to show that a selection needs to be made in order to move forward,
or that a selection that was made is invalid.

For example, in a form that requires a user to acknowledge legal terms before proceeding,
the checkbox would show an unchecked error to communicate that it needs to be selected.

  <ErrorView />
</Unstyled>
