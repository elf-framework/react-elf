# Switch

The switch allows the user to turn individual options on or off. Typically used to enable or disable certain settings.

## Usage

<Unstyled>
  <MainView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

## Options

### Label

Switches should always have labels. When the label is not defined, a
switch becomes standalone. Standalone switches should only be used
when their connection to other components is clear and they give
sufficient context — for example, in application panels.

<Unstyled>
  <OptionsView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Label} sourceState="shown" />

### Size

Switches come in four different sizes: small, medium, large, and
extra-large. The medium size is the default and most frequently used
option. Use the other sizes sparingly; they should be used to create a
hierarchy of importance within the page.

  <SizeView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Size} sourceState="shown" />

### Emphasis

By default, Switches are not emphasized (gray). This version is
optimal for when the Switch is not the core part of an interface, such
as in application panels, where all visual components are monochrome
in order to direct focus to the content.

The emphasized (blue) version provides a visual prominence that is
optimal for forms, settings, lists or grids of assets, and other
situations where a Switch need to be noticed.

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Emphasis} sourceState="shown" />

### Disabled

A Switch in a disabled state shows that a selection exists, but is not
available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain layout
continuity and communicate that an action may become available later.

<Unstyled>
  <DisabledView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Disabled} sourceState="shown" />

### Read only

Switches have a read-only option for when they’re in the disabled
state but still need their labels to be shown. This allows for content
to be copied, but not interacted with or changed.

<Unstyled>
  <ReadOnlyView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.ReadOnly} sourceState="shown" />

### With label view

You can also put text inside the switch. The font size is
automatically calculated by the switch height.

<Unstyled>
  <WithLabelView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.WithLabelView} sourceState="shown" />
