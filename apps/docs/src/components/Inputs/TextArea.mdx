# Text Area

A text area lets a user input a longer amount of text than a standard text field. It can include all of the standard validation options supported by the text field component.

  <MainView />

## Options

### Label

A Text area should always have a label. In rare cases where context
is sufficient and an accessibility expert has reviewed the design,
the label could be undefined. A text area without a visible label
should still include an aria-label in HTML (depending on the
context, “aria-label” or “aria-labelledby”).

  <OptionsView />
</Unstyled>

### Label position

Labels can be placed either on top or on the side. Top labels are
the default and are recommended because they work better with long
copy, localization, and responsive layouts. Side labels are most
useful when vertical space is limited.

### Value

The value shows a user’s entered text.

### Width

The width of a text area can be customized appropriately for its
context.

  <WidthView />
</Unstyled>

### Size

Text fields come in four different sizes: small, medium, large, and
extra-large. The medium size is the default and most frequently used
option. Use the other sizes sparingly; they should be used to create
a hierarchy of importance within the page.

  <SizeView />
</Unstyled>

### Required or Optional

Text fields can be marked as optional or required, depending on the
situation. For required text fields, there are two styling options:
a “(required)” label or an asterisk. If you use an asterisk, be sure
to include hint text to explain what the asterisk means. Optional
text fields are either denoted with text added to the end of the
label — “(optional)” — or have no indication at all.

The asterisk used in this component is an icon that has specific
spacing from the label text — not part of the label text itself.

### Disabled

A text field in a disabled state shows that an input field exists, but
is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain
layout continuity and communicate that a field may become available
later.

<Unstyled>
  <DisabledView />
</Unstyled>

### Read only

Text fields have a read-only option for when content in the disabled
state still needs to be shown. This allows for content to be copied,
but not interacted with or changed. A text field does not have a
read-only option if there is nothing entered in it.

<Unstyled>
  <ReadOnlyView />
</Unstyled>

### Help text(description and error message)

A text field can have help text below the field to give extra context
or instruction about what a user should input in the field. The help
text area has two options: a description and an error message. The
description communicates a hint or helpful information, such as
specific requirements for correctly filling out the field. The error
message communicates an error for when the field requirements aren’t
met, prompting a user to adjust what they had originally input.

  <HelpTextView />
</Unstyled>

### Resize drag handle

Text areas can either be a static size or can be resizable with a drag
icon in the bottom right corner. The drag icon should be hidden if the
fixed variant is turned off, or if the text area should not be
resizable.
