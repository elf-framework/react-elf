# Checkbox Group

A checkbox group is a grouping of checkboxes that are related to each other.

## Usage

<Unstyled>
  <MainView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={CheckboxGroupStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

## Options

### Size

Checkboxes come in four different sizes: small, medium, large, and extra-large. The medium size is the default and most frequently used option. Use the other sizes sparingly; they should be used to create a hierarchy of importance within the page.

<Unstyled>
  <SizeView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={CheckboxGroupStories.Size} sourceState="shown" />

### Disabled

A checkbox group in a disabled state shows that a selection exists,
but is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to
maintain layout continuity and communicate that an action may become
available later. The field label, checkboxes, and help text are all
displayed in a disabled state when the checkbox group is disabled.

<Unstyled>
  <DisabledView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={CheckboxGroupStories.Disabled} sourceState="shown" />

### Error

Checkboxes can be marked as having an error to show that a selection
needs to be made in order to move forward, or that a selection that
was made is invalid. For example, in a form that requires a user to
acknowledge legal terms before proceeding, the checkbox would show an
unchecked error to communicate that it needs to be selected.

<Canvas of={CheckboxGroupStories.Error} sourceState="shown" />
