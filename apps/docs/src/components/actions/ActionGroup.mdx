# Action Group

An action group is a grouping of action buttons that are related to each other.

## Usage

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

<Controls exclude={["onClick"]} />

## Options

### Orientation

An action group can be either horizontal or vertical in its
orientation. By default, an action group is horizontal. The vertical
option should be reserved for when horizontal space is limited.

  <OptionsView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Vertical} sourceState="shown" />

### Size

Action groups come in four different sizes: small, medium, large, and
extra-large. The medium size is the default and most frequently used
option. Use the other sizes sparingly; they should be used to create a
hierarchy of importance within the page.

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.SizeLarge} sourceState="shown" />

### Density

Action groups come in 2 densities: regular and compact. The compact
density retains the same font and icon sizes, but has tighter spacing.
The action buttons also become connected for non-quiet action groups.

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Compact} sourceState="shown" />

### Justified

Action groups come in 2 densities: regular and compact. The compact
density retains the same font and icon sizes, but has tighter spacing.
The action buttons also become connected for non-quiet action groups.

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Justified} sourceState="shown" />

### Quiet

By default, an action group uses not-quiet action buttons. This style
works best in a dense array of controls where the background helps to
separate action buttons from the surrounding container, or to give
visibility to isolated buttons.

Alternatively, quiet action groups can have no visible background
until theyâ€™re interacted with. This style works best when a clear
layout (vertical stack, table, grid) makes it easy to parse the
buttons. Too many quiet components in a small space can be hard to
read.

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Quiet} sourceState="shown" />

### Enable Selection

By default, selection is not enabled in an action group. This is used
for action groups that offer direct actions, rather than toggling.

Selection can be enabled for an action group to allow for toggling.
This can be used to disclose parts of an interface (e.g., showing or
hiding panels) or to switch between views (e.g., grid or list views).

<Unstyled>
  <EnableSelectionView />
</Unstyled>

&nbsp;

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Selection} sourceState="shown" />

### Multi Selection

When selection is enabled, an action group can allow for single or
multiple selection of action buttons.

<Unstyled>
  <MultiSelectionView />
</Unstyled>

&nbsp;

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.MultiSelection} sourceState="shown" />

### Overflow

When space is limited in an action group, there are 2 options for the
group's overflow behavior: wrap or collapse. By default, an action
group is set to wrap, meaning that the action buttons inside the group
wrap to form another line. Alternatively, an action group can be set
to collapse inside a More (...) action button.

<Unstyled>
  <OverflowView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Collapsed} sourceState="shown" />

### Disabled

A action group in a disabled state shows that the action buttons
within the group exist, but are not available in that circumstance.
This state can be used to maintain layout continuity and to
communicate that an action group may become available later.

<Unstyled>
  <DisabledView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={ActionGroupStories.Disabled} sourceState="shown" />
