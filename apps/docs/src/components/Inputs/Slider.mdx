# Slider

Sliders allow users to quickly select a value within a range. They should be used when the upper and lower bounds to the range are invariable.

## Options

### Label

Sliders should always have a label. In rare cases where context is
sufficient and an accessibility expert has reviewed the design, the
label could be undefined. These sliders should still include an
aria-label in HTML (depending on the context, “aria-label” or
“aria-labelledby”).

### Label Position

Labels can be placed either on top or on the side. Top labels are the
default and are recommended because they work better with long copy,
localization, and responsive layouts. Side labels are most useful when
vertical space is limited.

### Value, min value, max value and step

&nbsp;

The value is the number selected within the slider’s range, from the
min value to max value.

The min and max values can also be customized appropriately for
whatever the slider is showing. By default, the min value starts at 0
and the max value is set to 100.

The step is the increment by which these values increase or decrease.
A step value of 1 (the default) lets a user only select whole numbers
within the min and max range.

### Value format

Sometimes a value needs to be formatted for localization or for
clearer communication (e.g., currencies or percentages). Formatting
can involve rounding, mathematical transformations, number formatting,
or displaying a prefix or suffix (e.g., “+/-” or “px”).

### Fill

The track of the slider can have a fill. By default, the fill
originates from the left side of the track.

### Fill start

If the value represents an offset, the fill start can be set to
represent the point of origin. This allows the slider fill to start
from inside the track.

### Gradient

A gradient can be added to the track of any slider to give more
meaning to the range of values. Tracks with a gradient can also have a
fill. A gradient track should not be used for choosing a precise
color; use a color slider, color area, or color wheel instead.

### Disabled

A slider in a disabled state shows that an input exists, but is not available in that circumstance.
This can be used to maintain layout continuity and communicate that a slider may become available later.
