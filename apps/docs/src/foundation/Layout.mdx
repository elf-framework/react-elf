# Layout

## Application Frame

### Header bar

Header bar is the top bar of the application.

### Sidebar

The sidebar is a place for displaying tools and actions. It can be on either side of the application frame (left or right) or on both sides. Sidebars should be used on desktop and tablet â€” an alternative layout should be chosen on a phone. A small horizontal divider can be used to divide and organize groups of tools or actions related to each other.
