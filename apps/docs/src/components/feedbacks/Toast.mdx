# Toast

Toasts display brief, temporary notifications. They're meant to be noticed without disrupting a user's experience or requiring an action to be taken.

### Text

### Variant

The `informative` toast uses the informative semantic color
(blue) and has an info icon to help those with color vision deficiency
discern the message tone. Similar to the accent button, this should be
used when the message should call extra attention compared to the
neutral variant.

The `positive` toast uses the positive semantic color
(green) and has a checkmark icon to help those with color vision
deficiency discern the message tone. This is used to inform about a
successful action or completion of a task.

The `negative` toast uses the negative semantic color (red)
and has an alert icon to help those with color vision deficiency to
discern the message tone. This is used to show an error or failure.

The list of variants is as follows.
