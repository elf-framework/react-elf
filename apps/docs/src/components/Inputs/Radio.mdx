# Radio Group

A radio group is a grouping of radio buttons that are related to each other.

## Usage

<Unstyled>
  <MainView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

## Options

### Size

Radio groups come in four different sizes: small, medium, large, and
extra-large. The medium size is the default and most frequently used
option. Use the other sizes sparingly; they should be used to create a
hierarchy of importance within the page. The field label, radio
buttons, and help text all conform to the same sizing option.

  <SizeView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={RadioGroupStories.SizeLarge} sourceState="shown" />

### Disabled

A radio group in a disabled state shows that a selection exists, but
is not available in that circumstance. This can be used to maintain
layout continuity and communicate that an action may become available
later. The field label, radio buttons, and help text are all displayed
in a disabled state when the radio group is disabled.

### Error

Radio groups can be marked as having an error to show that a selection
needs to be made in order to move forward, or that a selection that
was made is invalid. The error is indicated with negative help text,
along with an icon.
