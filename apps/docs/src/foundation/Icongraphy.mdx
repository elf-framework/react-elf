# Icongraphy

An icon is a simple visual representation of a command, device, directory, or common operation.

## Metaphors

The metaphor of the icon is clear, powerful, and empirical.
Briefly and accurately describe the tools and topics as follows:

<IconView />

## Color

The icons are monochromatic.
The icon color varies depending on the interactive state (e.g., default, hover, disabled) and the color theme.

<ColorView />

## Size

The icons come in two sizes: 18 px for desktop scale and 22 px for mobile scale.
All icons are pixel-snapped and optimized for their specific size. Learn more about the platform scale system.

<SizeView />

## Workflow and UI icons

Workflow icons are graphical metaphors or symbols that users interact with to navigate and manipulate objects.
They all appear at the same size within each platform.
