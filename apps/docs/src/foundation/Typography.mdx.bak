# Typography

## Text Format

### Bold

Bold is used to add hierarchy within a sentence or to call attention, for example, in buttons and toasts.
It’s also used to directly refer to the names of UI elements in running text.

<BoldView />

### Italic

Italic is used only for placeholder (“ghost”) text and image captions.

<ItalicView />

### Underline

Underline is used only for text links and should never be used as a mechanism for adding emphasis.

<UnderlineView />

### Strong

Strong can be used for placing importance on part of a sentence, rendering the text as a heavier font weight.
This is for semantic formatting, when it’s intended to add a tone that conveys importance.

<StrongView />

### Emphasis

Emphasis can be used for placing emphasis on part of a sentence, rendering the text as italic.

<EmphasisView />
