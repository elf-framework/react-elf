# Alert Dialog

Alert dialogs display important information that users need to acknowledge. They appear over the interface and block further interactions until an action is selected.

## Usage

<Unstyled>
  <MainView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={DialogStories.Default} sourceState="shown" layout="centered" />

## Options

### Title

All alert dialogs must have a title. The title appears in bold at the
top of the dialog and uses a few words to convey the outcome of what
will happen if a user continues with an action.

<Unstyled>
  <TitleView />
</Unstyled>
<Canvas of={DialogStories.Title} sourceState="shown" layout="centered" />

### Description

Alert dialogs can include a description. A description briefly
communicates any additional information or context that a user needs
to know in order to make one of the decisions offered by the buttons.

<Unstyled>
  <DescriptionView />
</Unstyled>
<Canvas of={DialogStories.Description} sourceState="shown" layout="centered" />

### Confirmation Variant

This is the default variant for alert dialogs. Use a confirmation variant
for asking a user to confirm a choice. This alert dialog has an accent button to
highlight a strong preference for which action to take.

Dialogs can be canceled.
