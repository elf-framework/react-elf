# Progress Circle

Progress circles show the progression of a system operation such as downloading, uploading, processing, etc. in a visual way. They can represent determinate or indeterminate progress.

## Usage

<Unstyled>
  <MainView />
</Unstyled>

<Canvas of={ProgressCircleStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />

## Options

### Default variant

Progress circles are used to visually show the progression of a
system operation such as downloading, uploading, processing, etc. By
default, progress circles have a blue fill that shows the progress.

<Unstyled>
  <DefaultVariantView />
</Unstyled>

### Over background variant

When a progress circle needs to be placed on top of a colored
background, use the over background variant. This progress circle
uses a static white color regardless of the color theme. Make sure
the background offers enough contrast for the progress circle to be
legible.

  <OverBackgroundVariantView />
</Unstyled>

### Value, min value, max value

The value is the progress of a system operation (e.g., downloading,
uploading, processing) within the progress circle’s range, from the
min value to max value.

The min and max values can also be customized appropriately for
whatever the progress circle is showing. By default, the min value
starts at 0 and the max value is set to 100.

These values are not applicable when a progress circle is
indeterminate.

  <MinMaxValueView />
</Unstyled>

### Size

Progress circles come in 3 sizes: small, medium (default), or large.
These are available to fit various contexts. For example, the small
progress circle can be used in place of an icon or in tight spaces,
while the large one can be used for full-page loading.

  <SizeView />
</Unstyled>

### Indeterminate

A progress circle can be either determinate or indeterminate. By
default, progress circles are determinate. Use a determinate
progress circle when progress can be calculated against a specific
goal (e.g., downloading a file of a known size). Use an
indeterminate progress circle when progress is happening but the
time or effort to completion can’t be determined (e.g., attempting
to reconnect to a server).

### spin animation

When part of the page is waiting for asynchronous data or during a
rendering process, an appropriate loading animation can effectively
alleviate users' inquietude.
